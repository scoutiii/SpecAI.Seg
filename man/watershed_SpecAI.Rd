the RCMG functions.}

\item{tolerance}{The tolerance to be used by the watershed algorithm.}

\item{ext}{A smoothing parameter to be used in the watershed algorithm}
}
\value{
A segmented image built from the gradient, in the form of a matrix.
}
\description{
Run the watershed algorithm on the gradient of an HSI image.
